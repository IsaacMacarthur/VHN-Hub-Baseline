To run the baseline model for the hub, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repo, and put it in the same folder as the VHN repo.
2. Edit the line: VNH_repo_name <- c("variant-nowcast-hub_summary"), to match what you named the VHN repo in the baseline_model.R file.
3. Set the wd to be the src folder.
4. Change the target_date to the date you want.
5. Run the  baseline_model.R script.
